# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to sort through written reviews of books purchased on Amazon - inlcuding both paid reviews (via Amazon Vine program) and unpaid reviews.

The Amazon Vine program offers products to users for free, in return for reviews. In our study, we would like to determine whether this creates a bias for a more favorable review or not.

## Results

- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

    This dataset contained 416,341 product reviews, of which 4,972 were Vine reviews and 411,369 were non-Vine reviews.

- How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

    There are 1,571 5 star Vine reviews and 171,623 5 star non-Vine reviews.

- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

    31% of Vine reviews are 5 stars, whereas 41% of non-Vine reviews are 5 stars.


## Summary

Based on this 5-star review analysis, I can determine that there is not significant bias in the Vine program for books. Vine reviewers were slightly less favorable than non-Vine reviewers (31% vs 41%).

Although the 5-star analysis didn't have bias, it would be interesting to also analyze all of the positive reviews - anything over 3.5 stars. Perhaps that would show that Vine reviews were positively biased.
